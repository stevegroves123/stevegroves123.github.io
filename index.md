### About Me

> I am an old, daft and slightly mad guy who like to be creative, 
> either using electronics to create silly gadets or software to create Apple IOS or WatchIOS apps.

An example of one silly creation is [Water app for Apple Watch](https://github.com/stevegroves123/WaterLog)

For playing with virtual electronics I use TinkerCad.[stevegroves123](https://www.tinkercad.com/login)

```swift
import UIKit

enum Result {
    case Success(score: Int)
    case Failure(score: Int)
}

let scored = 1

switch scored {
case 0..<75:
    let examResult = Result.Failure(score: scored)
    print(examResult)
case 75...100:
    let examResult = Result.Success(score: scored)
    print(examResult)
default:
    let examResult = "Unknown score"
    print(examResult)
}
```

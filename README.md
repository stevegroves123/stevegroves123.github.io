Steve Groves site

This project site hosts my attempt to create a shopping list app - I'm terrible when I go shopping, like a kid who is running around a topy shop looking at all the toys, I move around a supermarket randomly running from isle to isle.

The app is going to be designed to keep me in check by showing what I need, where it will be packed away at home and the needed quantity.

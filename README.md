Steve Groves site

This project site hosts my attempt to create a shopping list app - I'm terrible when I go shopping, like a kid who is running around a toy shop looking at all the toys; I move around a supermarket randomly running from one isle to next.

Hopefully, the app will be designed to keep me in check by showing what is needed, where it will be packed away, and the quantity needed.
